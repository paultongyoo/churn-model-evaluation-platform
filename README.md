## Problem Statement

* Companies rely on churn prediction models to proactively retain valuable customers--an effort that is typically more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.
* However, once deployed, these models risk losing accuracy over time as customer behavior and demographics shift.
* This project addresses this challenge by providing Data Scientists, Machine Learning Engineers, and their stakeholders a platform to continuously train, deploy, and monitor churn models, enabling organizations to detect drift, maintain model quality, and adapt to changing customer dynamics.

## Customer Churn Data Source

* The labeled customer churn data used to train the model was randomly collected from an Iranian telecom company on 4/8/2020 and made available for download by the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository ‚Üó](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/563/iranian+churn+dataset).
* This repository contains a `data/` folder with several CSV files prefixed with `customer_churn_*`.
* The following files were split from the original Iranian Telecom dataset:
   * `customer_churn_0.csv` (used as training set)
   * `customer_churn_1.csv`
   * `customer_churn_2.csv`
* The `customer_churn_synthetic_*.csv` files were generated by [Gretel.ai ‚Üó](https://www.gretel.ai) using the original dataset as input.

## Platform Processes

Two independent processes were enabled by this project, joined by the MLflow Model Registry:

### Model Training and Registry Deployment

The following process is implemented with two files inside the `code/orchestration/modeling/` folder:
* **Jupyter Notebook:** `churn_model_training.ipynb`
	* Main location for EDA, hyperparameter tuning, and calling upon the `modeling.churn_model_training` module below
* **Python Module:** `churn_model_training.py`
	* Contains functions used in both Jupyter Notebook and in Prefect Flow `churn_prediction_pipeline.py` (see [Model Inference, Reporting, and Evaluation](#model-inference-reporting-and-evaluation) section below)

### Model Inference, Reporting, and Evaluation

* The following process is orchestrated by the Prefect Flow `code/orchestration/churn_prediction_pipeline.py`.
* A new flow run is created for each file dropped into the S3 File Drop Folder `input` folder (see [S3 File Drop Folder Structure](#s3-file-drop-folder-structure)).

## Security Limitations & Future Improvements

| Security Limitation | Future Improvement |
| ------------------- | ------------------ |
| The IAM policy used is intentionally broad to reduce setup complexity. | Replace with least-privilege policies tailored to each service role.  |
| Public subnets are required to simplify RDS access from ECS and local machines. | Migrate to private subnets with NAT Gateway and use bastion or VPN access for local clients.  |
| The Prefect API ALB endpoint is publicly accessible to enable GitHub Actions deployment. | Restrict access to GitHub Actions IP ranges using ingress rules or CloudFront. |
| The MLflow ALB endpoint is publicly accessible to allow ECS Workers to reach the Model Registry.  | Limit access to internal ECS security groups only.  |
| The Prefect API ALB endpoint is visible in cleartext as an environment variable in the `.github/workflows/deploy-prefect.yml` file.  This may pose a security risk if your GitHub repo is publicly visible. | Consider migrating this variable to a GitHub Repository secret and automatically upserting this value as a new Terraform action post-`apply`. |

## Installation Prerequisites

* Python 3.10.x
* [AWS Account ‚Üó](https://aws.amazon.com/)
    * AWS Account required to deploy the pipeline to the cloud and run it as a user
    * AWS Account NOT required to run unit and integration tests
* AWS User with the [Required IAM Permissions](#required-iam-permissions) policies
* [AWS CLI ‚Üó](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) installed with `aws configure` run to store AWS credentials locally

* GitHub Account
  * At this time, committing repo to your GitHub account and running GitHub Actions workflow is the only way to deploy Prefect flow to Prefect Server (without manual effort to circumvent)

### Required IAM Permissions

A user with the following AWS Managed Permissions policies was used when creating this Platform.  **Please note that this list is *overly-permissive* and may be updated in the future.**

* `AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess`
* `AmazonEC2FullAccess`
* `AmazonECS_FullAccess`
* `AmazonRDSFullAccess`
* `AmazonS3FullAccess`
* `AmazonSNSFullAccess`
* `AmazonLambda_FullAccess`
* `CloudWatchLogsFullAccess`
* `IAMFullAccess`

## Docker Local Image Storage Space Requirements

The Docker images required for the following components occupy approximately 5.4‚ÄØGB of local disk space:
* **Custom Grafana Bundle**
    * Packages database configuration and dashboard files with Grafana Enterprise
    * Uses Grafana `grafana/grafana-enterprise:12.0.2-security-01` image
* **S3-to-Prefect Lambda Function**
    * Invokes orchestration flow when new files are dropped into S3
    * Uses AWS `public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.12` image
* **Testcontainers + LocalStack**
	* Used by integration tests to mock AWS S3 service using LocalStack
 	* Uses LocalStack `localstack/localstack:4.7.0` image

After deployment, remove these local Docker images to conserve space.

## Library Dependencies & Version Numbers

See the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files within the following folders for the full lists of library dependencies and version numbers used:

* `code/orchestration/`
* `code/s3_to_prefect_lambda/`

## How to Install Platform

1.  Install the [prerequisites](#installation-prerequisites)
2.  Ensure your Docker Engine is running
1.  Create an S3 bucket to store the state of your Terraform infrastructure (e.g. `churn-platform-tf-state-<some random number>`)
1.  Clone `churn-model-evaluation-platform` repository locally
1.  Edit root Terraform configuration to store state within S3
    1.  Edit file: `{REPO_DIR}/infrastructure/main.tf`
    1.  Change `terraform.backend.s3.bucket` to the name of the bucket you created
    1.  Change `terraform.backend.s3.region` to your AWS region
1.  Copy Terraform `infrastructure/vars/stg.template.tfvars` file to new `infrastructure/vars/stg.tfvars` file and define values for each key within:

| **Key Name** | **Purpose** | **Example Value** |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------------- |
| `project_id` | Used as prefix for many AWS resources, including the S3 bucket while files will be dropped and generated.  **Must be a valid S3 name (e.g. unique, no underscores).  Must be 20 characters or less to prevent exceeding resource naming character limits.**   | `mlops-churn-pipeline` |
| `vpc_id` | Your AWS VPC ID | `vpc-0a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8` |
| `aws_region` | Your AWS Region | `us-east-2` |
| `db_username` | Username for Postgres database used to store MLflow, Prefect, and Evidently Metrics.  Must conform to Postgres rules (e.g. lowercase, numbers, underscores only) | `my_super_secure_db_name` |
| `db_password` | Password for Postgres database. Use best practices and avoid spaces. | `Th1s1sAStr0ng#Pwd!` |
| `grafana_admin_user` | Username for Grafana account used to **edit** data drift and model prediction scores over time.  | `grafana_FTW` |
| `grafana_admin_password` | Password for Grafana account | `Grafana4Lyfe!123` |
| `subnet_ids`  | AWS Subnet IDs: **Must be *public* subnet IDs from *different Availability Zones* to allow Postgres RDS instance to be accessed by ECS services (and optionally your IP address)** | `["subnet-123abc456def78901", "subnet-234bcd567efg89012"]` |
| `my_ip` | IP address that will be granted access to Grafana UI, Optuna UI and Postgres DB | `203.0.113.42` |
| `my_email_address` | Email address that will be notified if input files exhibit data drift or prediction scores that exceed thresholds | `your.name@example.com` |

1.  `cd {REPO_DIR}/infrastructure` then `terraform init`.  If successful, this command will populate the Terraform State S3 bucket you created in Step 2 with the necessary files to capture the state of your infrastructure across Terraform command invocations.
2.  `cd {REPO_DIR}/code/orchestration` then `pipenv shell`
3.  `cd {REPO_DIR}`
1.  Run `make plan` and review the infrastructure to be created (see [Platform Infrastructure Diagram](#platform-infrastructure-diagram)
1.  Run `make apply` to build Terraform infrastructure, set Prefect Secrets, update GitHub Actions workflow YAML, and start ECS services.
    1.  After Terraform completes instantiating each ECS Service, it will execute the `wait_for_services.sh` script to poll the ALB URLs until each service instantiates its ECS Task and the service is ready for use.
    1.  For the user's convenience, each tool's URL is displayed to the user once ready for use (see [Platform ECS Services](#platform-ecs-services)).
1.  Click each of the 5 ECS Service URLs to confirm they are running: MLflow, Optuna, Prefect Server, Evidently, Grafana
1.  Run `make deploy-model` to train a `XGBoostChurnModel` churn model and upload it to the MLflow Model Registry with `staging` alias.
    1.  Confirm it was created and aliased by visiting the Model Registry within the MLflow UI
    2.  Note two versions of the model are visible in the registry evaluated using training and holdout datasets (`X_train` and `X_test`, respectively)
1.  Deploy the `churn_prediction_pipeline` Prefect Flow to your Prefect Server using GitHub Actions
    1. Commit your cloned repo (including `{REPO_DIR}/.github/workflows/deploy-prefect.yml` updated with generated `PREFECT_API_URL`)
    1. Log in to your GitHub account, navigate to your committed repo project and create the following [Repository Secrets ‚Üó](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/use-secrets) (used by `deploy-prefect.yml`):
        1.  `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`
        1.  `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
        1.  `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
        1.  `AWS_REGION`
    1.  Navigate to GitHub Project Actions tab, select the workflow `Build and Deploy Prefect Flow to ECR`, and click the green "Run workflow" button to deploy the Prefect flow
    	  1. Confirm it was deployed sucessfully by visiting the "Deployments" section of the Prefect UI
1.  Confirm your email subscription to the pipeline SNS topic
    1.  Navigate to the inbox of the email address you configured in `stg.tfvars` and look for an email subject titled `AWS Notification - Subscription Confirmation`.
    1.  Open the email and click the `Confirm Subscription` link within.
    1.  Verify you see a green message relaying your subscription has been confirmed.

## Platform ECS Services

Once the Terraform `make apply` command completes successfully, you should see output similar to the following that provides you URLs to each of the created tools:
```
üéâ All systems go! üéâ

MLflow, Optuna, Prefect, Evidently, and Grafana UI URLs
-------------------------------------------------------

üß™ MLflow UI: http://your-project-id-alb-123456789.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com:5000
üîç Optuna UI: http://your-project-id-alb-123456789.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8080
‚öôÔ∏è Prefect UI: http://your-project-id-alb-123456789.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com:4200
üìà Evidently UI: http://your-project-id-alb-123456789.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com:8000
üìà Grafana UI: http://your-project-id-alb-123456789.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com:3000
```

Clicking on each URL should render each tool's UI successfully in your browser (the Terraform command includes invoking a script that polls the services' URLs until they return successful responses).

If any of the URLs return an error (e.g. 503 Service Unavailable), investigate the root cause by logging into the AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) console and inspect the logs of the ECS Task that is failing.

If all the services started auccessfully, your ECS Task list should look similar to this screenshot:

![Platform ECS Tasks Screenshot](readme-assets/pipeline_ecs_tasks.png)

These URLs were also written to the `{REPO_DIR}/.env` file for future retrieval and export to shell environment when needed.

## How to Upload Data

1. Navigate to `{REPO_DIR}` (and run `cd code/orchestration && pipenv shell` if you haven't already)
2. You can process the labeled Customer Churn data in one of two ways:

   1. Use `upload_simulation_script.py` script to upload non-training data files 30-seconds apart to [S3 File Drop `input` Folder](#s3-file-drop-folder-structure)

      1. Edit `upload_simulation_script.py` to change the `BUCKET_NAME` value to match the `project_id` you configured in `stg.tfvars`
      1. Run `make simulate-file-drops` from `{REPO_DIR}` to run the script `upload_simulation_script.py` which uploads each file in the `data` folder (except `customer_churn_0.csv`) to the S3 bucket folder

   2. Manually upload files from the `{REPO_DIR}/data` folder into the S3 bucket `{PROJECT_ID}/data/input` folder


## How to Evaluate Data Drift & Model

Once your files have completed processing (as visible via Prefect UI or seeing them appear in S3 `data/processed/` folder), you can evaluate their data in two ways:

1.  Navigate to the Evidently UI to view detailed data drift metrics and prediction scores for each file
2.  Navigate to the Grafana UI and view the pre-built **"Customer Churn Model Evaluation"** dashboard to view how the drift metrics and prediction scores have behaved over time

## Data Drift & Prediction Score Email Alerts

The pipeline will send an email to the address configured within `stg.tfvars` in each of the following scenarios:

### Data Drift Alert
Sent if Evidently finds more than 50% of the new customer data set columns have drifted from the reference data set:
![Data Drift Email Alert Example](readme-assets/email-alert-data-drift.png)

### Prediction Score Alert
Sent if Evidently reports any of the observed prediction scores drop below 70%:
* F1 Score
* Precision
* Recall
* Accuracy

## Unit Test Examples

Example unit tests can be found within the `code/orchestration/tests/unit/` folder for select Prefect @task functions of `churn_prediction_pipeline.py`.

The `unittest.TestCase`, `unittest.mock.Patch`, and `unittest.mock.MagicMock` classes were used to create reused test fixture code that overrode ("patch"-ed) class object references with mock objects.

## Integration Test Examples

Example integration tests can be found within the `code/orchestration/tests/integration/` folder for the `validate_file_input` @task function of `churn_prediction_pipeline.py`.

In order to integration test the function is correctly reading files from S3, the [`testcontainers.localstack` module ‚Üó](https://testcontainers-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/modules/localstack/README.html) was used to dynamically create a [LocalStack ‚Üó](https://www.localstack.cloud) container that served as a mock S3 endpoint for the `s3_client` calls made by the `validate_file_input` function.

## Pre-Commit Hooks

### How to Activate Pre-Commit Hooks

The following steps are required to activate pre-commit hooks for this repository:

1.  Navigate to `{REPO_DIR}/code/orchestration/` and run `pipenv shell` if you haven't already
2.  Navigate to `{REPO_DIR}` and run `pre-commit install`
3.  Ensure your Docker Engine is running (needed for LocalStack-based integration tests)
4.  Run `make quality` to generate the required `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file and execute the hooks

Generating `.pre-commit-config.yaml` was needed to inject the absolute path to the `code/orchestration/modeling` module folder for `pylint` (future improvement: use relative path instead).  For this reason, `.pre-commit-config.yaml` is included in `.gitignore` to not commit cleartext absolute path in case you commit your repo publicly.

### Hooks List

The following hooks are used to maintain notebook and module code quality and execute tests prior to commiting files to Git:

* `nbqa-pylint`
* `nbqa-flake8`
* `nbqa-black`
* `nbqa-isort`
* `trailing-whitespace`
* `end-of-file-fixer`
* `check-yaml`
* `check-added-large-files`
* `isort`
* `black`
* `pylint`
* `pytest-check`

## Makefile Targets

The following table lists the `make` targets available to accelerate platform deployment, development, and testing:
| Target Name | Purpose |
| ------------| ------- |
| `test` | Runs all unit and integration tests defined within `code/orchestration` and `code/s3_to_prefect_lambda` folders |
| `quality` | Runs `pre-commit run --all-files`.  See [Pre-Commit Hooks](#pre-commit-hooks) |
| `commit` | Stages all changed files, prompts user for commit message, and attempts to commit the files (barring pre-commit errors) |
| `plan` | Runs `terraform plan --var-file=vars/stg.tfvars` from `infrastructure` directory |
| `apply` | Runs `terraform apply --var-file=vars/stg.tfvars --auto-approve` and outputs emoji-filled message with UI URLs upon successful deploy and ECS Task activation |
| `destroy` | Runs `terraform destroy -var-file=vars/stg.tfvars --auto-approve` |
| `disable-lambda` | Used to facilitate local dev/testing: Disables notification of the `s3_to_prefect` Lambda function so files aren't automatically picked up by the deployed service.  Lets you drop file(s) manually in S3 and run the pipeline locally when you're ready (see `process-test-data` target below). |
| `enable-lambda` | Re-enables the `s3_to_prefect` Lambda notification to resume creating new Prefect flow runs on S3 file drop |
| `deploy-model` | <ul><li>Executes the `churn_model_training.py` file to train and deploy two models to the MLflow Registry (evaluated on training and holdout data, respectively).</li><li>The second model is assigned the `staging` alias to allow the Prefect pipeline to fetch the latest `staging` model without code changes.</li><li>Note: Hyperparameter tuning is NOT performed with this target to accelerate model deployment.  See `log-model-nopromote` target if hyperparameter tuning is desired.</li></ul> |
| `log-model-nopromote` | <ul><li>Executes the `churn_model_training.py` file to train and deploy two models to MLflow without executing promotion steps (e.g. does not apply `staging` alias).</li><li>Used to develop and optimize model performance prior to making it available for stakeholder use.</li><li>**Hyperparameter Tuning Notes:**<ul><li>Optuna Bayesian hyperparameter tuning is performed with this target, with the number of trials currently set to 50.</li><li>Modify churn_model_training.py to adjust the number of trials if desired.  Optuna recommends executing at least 20-30 trials to accumulate enough prior runs to optimize parameters.</li><li>Allot approximately 10 minutes for the trials to complete (actual time varies based on local machine performance and network connectivity).</li><li>Suggested optimization approach:<ul><li>Use the Optuna UI to correlate parameter ranges with higher F1 scores</li><li>Use insights to narrow the parameter search space used in `churn_model_training.py`</li><li>Once you've chosen the optimal parameters, modify the `best_params_to_date` variable in `churn_model_training.py` so that they are used in subsequent executions of the `deploy-model` target</li></ul></li></li></ul></li></ul>  |
| `process-test-data` | Use to manually invoke flow after running `disable-lambda` target.  **Upload `customer_churn_1.csv` into the S3 `data/input/` folder before use.**  Runs command `python churn_prediction_pipeline.py your-project-id data/input/customer_churn_1.csv` and instantiates ephemeral local Prefect Server to execute flow. |
| `simulate-file-drops` | Runs `upload_simulation_script.py` to automatically upload each non-training data file in the `data/` folder to the S3 File Drop input folder. |
